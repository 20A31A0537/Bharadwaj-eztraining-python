day 2:

Polymorphism: one item or same item used for different purpose
-> types:
       1.overloading:
                   I.operater overloading:
                         ex:5+10=15       integer addition with + operator
                            "5"+"10"=510   string concatination with + operator
                   II.method overloading
       2.over riding:if a method is deffective cannot be used inside derived class 
                      it will take from its base class or parent class

Data Stuctures:
                LINEAR:: Array/linked list/Stack/Matrix (storing data seuentially)
                         array is STATIC and LIST,STACK,QUEUE is DYNAMIC
                NON LINEAR: Binary Tree/Heap/Hash Table/Graph (no sequential style required)
                
  ->Linked list:real time example train 
                as the name says list of items which are linked with another is called as linked list.
                Every list ha node and each node has 2 segments,
                       1.Data
                       2.Address
                **types:
                        1.singly
                        2.double
                        3.circular
Creating Linked list:
Step1: Create the node 
Step2: Partition the node with 2 segments data and none
step3: Add value into the blank node
Step4: Mark the node as head
Step5: Create the next node by following the above steps
Step6: Establish link between first node and second node

Displaying Linked List:Traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display
                       existing linked list
